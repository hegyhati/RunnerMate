  We often take for granted, what we already have.
  It was the same for me with the <a href="https://runinbudapest.com/" target="_blank">races organized in Budapest</a>, as I've been running them for years.
  Having participated in a few races abroad recently, however, made me open my mind, and appreciate these events a lot more. 
</p>

<p>
  If You are thinking about starting to run races abroad, I can highly recommend Budapest, and here are the 5+1 reasons, why: 
</p>


<h2>1. The scenery</h2>
<p>
  It is not a secret, that I am not very fond of big cities, and prefer small towns closer to nature.
  Thus, Budapest is definitely not my favorite city in Hungary, but even I have to admit, that our capital is full of beauty.
  If You don't believe me, watch this short clip:
</p>

<p>
  And the best thing is: if You come to one of the big races (<a href="https://springhalfmarathon.runinbudapest.com/" target="_blank">Telekom Vivicitta Spring Half Marathon</a>,  <a href="https://halfmarathon.runinbudapest.com/" target="_blank">Wizz Air Budapest Half Marathon</a> or <a href="https://marathon.runinbudapest.com/" target="_blank">SPAR Budapest Marathon</a>), You will see most of the things in the above video, as the races usually stay close to the Danube, providing an excellent view!
</p>

<p>
  I have been to some races in really beautiful cities, where I did not see anything from the beautiful parts of the city.
  That is always a bit disappointing, but You will never experience that in Budapest.
  The races usually cross the Danube several times on different bridges, and You run along the river on both sides for a while.
  As a result, You got to see by beautiful places along the river like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Parliament_Building" target="_blank">Parliament</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda_Castle" target="_blank">Buda Castle</a> from really close and also from the other side of the river.
  But You also got to cross the <a href="https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/buda-castle-tunnel-2/" target="_blank">Castle tunnel</a> tunnel, and the race center is always in a nice green area, either on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Island" target="_blank">Margaret Island</a> or the in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Park_(Budapest)" target="_blank">City Park</a> that is right next to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%91s%C3%B6k_tere" target="_blank">Heroes' Square</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>To sum it up: Budapest not only has beautiful things to show, but it really does show them on the races.</b>
</p>

<h2>2. Price to value ratio</h2>

<p>
  Hungary is the south-east-most country of Central Europe.
  As a result, prices are definitely lower for most of the things here than in Western Europe for example.
  And races are not exceptions either.
  If You register on for the autumn half marathon on time, it will only cost You 40 EUR, or 28 if You are a returning runner, 19 if You are a student.
</p>

<p>
  Price, however, is only one part of the equation.
  What about the quality of the race, the refreshments, etc?
  Well, my dear reader, in this aspect, the races in Budapest are definitely among the best ones according to my experience.
  The organizers are not greenhorn newbies.
  The three races mentioned above will be organized for the 33rd time each.
  This means, that the organizers have accumulated a lot of experience, how to organize a good race, that the runners really enjoy, constantly improving based on original ideas, and observing other races in the world.
</p>

<p>
  Just to mention a few things:
  <ul>
    <li>A lot of info, route video, tips, etc. before the race</li>
    <li>Race package with a nicely designed technical shirt, the bib with chip, a booklet containing all the necessary information, maps, etc.</li>
    <li>Pace zones at the start</li>
    <li>Plenty of refreshment stations along the way with water, isotonic drinks, bananas, biscuits, etc.</li>
    <li>Tons of music spots</li>
    <li>Official photographers, photos being able to be purchased a few days later based on the bib number </li>
    <li>Beautiful medal and a finisher package with some stuff to eat</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  It is also important to note, that the organizers are fully prepared for foreign runners.
  This is not surprising, as thousands of them are already visiting Budapest every year for a while now.
  So You will not need to google translate your way through everything if You choose Budapest :-)
</p>

<p>
  Also, take into consideration, that You will probably want to spend a few days in the city, country before and after the race.
  Hungary will be easier on Your wallet not just at the registration, but also in booking a hotel, visiting a spa, or having a nice dinner with local specialties. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>To sum it up: You will get "western quality" for "eastern prices".</b>

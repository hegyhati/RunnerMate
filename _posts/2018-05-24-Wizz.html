intro: Quick post about how I run abroad.

<p>
  Recently, a major change could be observed in my running habits: I tend to run more and more abroad. 
  I've always packed my running shoes when I traveled to another country for work related purposes, but in the last few weeks, I've made trips just for the sake of running.
  This is mostly thanks to a low-cost airline company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizz_Air" target="_blank">Wizz Air</a>. 
  In this post, I aim to tell You my story, and share my experiences to provide a little bit of guidance if You want to do something similar.

  I simply like their service and believe, that the information below could be interesting for a lot of fellow runners.

<h3>How it all started</h3>

<p>
  Last year I was really lucky to have my teaching visit in <a href="/2017/07/22/Iceland.html">Iceland</a> at the time of the Reykjavik Spring Marathon. 
  After that marathon, I started dreaming about running marathons in as many countries as possible. 
  I thought traveling to be pretty expensive, so I expected my <a href="/marathonmap.html">Marathonmap</a> to "progress" really slowly.
  Fast forwarding to this year, I had another Erasmus visit planned to Cyprus, and this time, I tried to schedule things  so, that I can run a marathon there too. 
  Luckily, there were two of them organized in March, and my work-trip was just right after the one in Limassol. 
</p>

<p>
  When I was searching for my flights, I ended up on the <a href="wizzair.com">site of Wizz Air</a>.
  As a Hungarian person, I obviously knew of the company, and I've even traveled with them a couple of times beforehand for conferences, research visits, etc. 
  However, I've never really examined all the options, discounts available before, as it was usually my University dealing with the booking of tickets. 
  This time, I spent probably 1 or 2 hours of studying all the rules and options before finally booking my tickets to Larnaca. 
  I realized, that the allowed free cabin luggage is large enough to have all the clothes that I need for a short visit, and even for my 9 day visit if I can somehow wash my clothes, which is much cheaper than paying for a check-in luggage.
  The only downside was, that I needed to brig my notebook with me, which also takes up big space, and it is too fragile to go to the bottom of the plane if there is not enough space in the cabin. 
  Luckily, the <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/wizz-services/wizz-priority#/" target="_blank">Priority check-in</a> option of Wizz solves both of these issues for a very decent price. 
  And then I was asked if I want to become a discount member or not, and I believe, that this was the point, where everything started...  
</p>

<h3>Becoming a member of the <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/wizz-services/wizz-discount-club#/" target="_blank">Wizz discount club</a></h3>
<p>
  The membership fee for a year is 30 EUR, and it ensures 10 EUR discount on all flights, so it doesn't require a PhD in Mathematics to realize, that it is really beneficial to become a member if someone travels at least twice a year. 
  So I did exactly that when I booked my tickets to Larnaca. 
  This meant however, that I always got the mails from Wizz about daily discounts, and special offers, which made me book 7 further flights since then. 
  But let's not get ahead of us, and break this text-monotony with some nice photos about running in Cyprus. 
  (There will be a separate post about my experiences there, so this is just a brief teaser.)

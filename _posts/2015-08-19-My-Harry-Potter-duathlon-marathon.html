<span style="font-family: inherit;">So last November<!-- Well, the Hobbit premiered in December, so this happened in December. I'm just curious, whether somebody realizes this or not. The first one will get a free beer ;-) --> I was having a chat on
facebook with one of my friends, who is a competitive runner in 1500
and 3000 meters. The discussion was something like this:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.49in;">
<a href="/assets/2015-08-19-My-Harry-Potter-duathlon-marathon/hpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="/assets/2015-08-19-My-Harry-Potter-duathlon-marathon/hpm.png" width="303" /></a></div>
Me: Hey, what's up?<br />
<br />
Her: Hi, sorry, I'll go soon. Me and my friends plan to do a “Hobbit marathon” in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
Me: You mean watching all three movies in a row?<br />
<br />
Her: Exactly!<br />
<br />
Me: Neat! I once had an idea of doing a similar thing with the Harry Potter movies. Only, I thought to run in the breaks between them. But the person to whom I told it said I was crazy. <br />
<br />
Her: I think it sounds great!<br />
<br />
Me: Ok, we will get back to this then :-)<br />

<br /></div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
So this is how it all began... Since my friend has a strict training plan, we had to wait a lot with the implementation of the idea, but it was worth it. We already agreed, that our “basis of operation” will be my flat, and we will have a 6k run between all the movies, resulting in exactly 42 kilometers. Also it has been a long time for both of us to watch these movies / read the books, so many things were foggy already.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Last week She told me, that they have a
break with the trainings, so we could do the marathon this Monday and
Tuesday. Then I started sorting out the details. Since the weather
was “mordorish” in Hungary (nearly through the whole summer), we
decided to start everything in the afternoon, and do the runnings in
the night, when it is “only” 30 Celsius (86F) outside. Then I did
some math:</span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<ul>
<li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">The length of all the HP movies
 together are nearly <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-long-are-each-of-the-Harry-Potter-films">20
 hours</a>. 
 </span></div>
</li>
<li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Running 42k for me is around 3.5
 hours. 
 </span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">So in the end, it doesn't really matter
when we start. Next step was to plan the route for 6k runs. I wanted
to have as much variety in the tracks as possible. This part was
rather tricky, but in the end, I made 7 routes in RunKeeper. <a href="http://u.osmfr.org/m/49613/">Here</a>
they are on top of each other (drawn by uMap):</span></div>

<a href="/assets/2015-08-19-My-Harry-Potter-duathlon-marathon/tracks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="361" src="/assets/2015-08-19-My-Harry-Potter-duathlon-marathon/tracks.png" width="400" /></a>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Everything was ready, and finally the
day has come! First we went to supermarket to buy some biscuits,
chocolates, fruits, etc. for the 24 hour challenge. Then, everything
started around 3:30pm on Monday with</span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movie 1/8: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - 152 minutes</span></h4>
</div>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">This one brought back a lot of memories from 10+ years ago. It was
really funny to see the the now Queen of 9gag as a niminy-piminy
little girl. Meanwhile, a really huge storm started, and didn't
finish until the movie ended.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/636474266">Run 1/7</a></span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">As it was still raining heavily, we skipped the first two planned
tracks, that went into the forest, and started with the 3<sup>rd</sup>
one. After weeks of sauna, it was really nice to run in the rain.
Also, my friend is a much faster runner, than I am, so I probably did
my PB for 6k. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movie 2/8: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - 161 minutes</span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">After we got dry again, and hang the wet clothes, we started the
second movie, and ordered a pizza, which arrived right before the
movie ended. Both still cheerful, time went by pretty fast, and it
got really dark outside, but the rain stopped at last. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/636639672">Run 2/7</a></span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Due to the rain and the late hours, it was really nice and quiet
in the city, and this 6k went by smoothly as well. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movie 3/8: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - 142 minutes</span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Things are getting dark in the movies too. Also, this was the time
we realized, that the movie watching part will be much more difficult
than we expected. We were really waiting for that 6k to stretch our
legs a little. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/636711302">Run 3/7</a></span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">This was a really nice one, with a lot of elevation, visiting the
castle, etc. Quickly done, ready for the Triwizard tournament!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movie 4/8: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - 157 minutes</span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Poor not-yet sparkling Cedric. But who cares... Dragons! 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/636849364">Run 4/7</a></span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">This was the most crazy track I planned in a way. The basic
concept was to turn left, then turn right, and repeat. Anyway, at 3k
we were halfway through, and finished around 4 am. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movie 5/8: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - 138 minutes</span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Dumbledore's army! Seriously, this was my favorite book. I think
this was the book, in which I could find the most analogy with real
life. The relation of politics and education, media cover-ups, etc.
Annoyingly lovable.  
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/636902231">Run 5/7</a></span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">My friend had to be at the bus station at 8:30 am, thus we decided
to have a 90 minute nap, and then start with the track that goes
close by. Because of this detour and a non-existing path, we ended up
running 7k instead of 6, but it was nice, though the city was already
awake. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movie 6/8: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - 153 minutes</span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Despite the short nap, we both were already really exhausted, but
luckily, a friend of ours joined for this one. Halfway through,my
friend got a message, that She will have a training session in the
afternoon, so She had to stop here, and go to have some sleep before
that. 
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/636996985">Runs 6</a><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/hegyhati/activity/637024095">&amp;7/7</a></span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">My friend motivated me a lot during everything so far, so I was
pretty sad to left alone. Anyway, I decided to do the last two runs
right after each other, have a shower, then watch the movies made
from the last book together lying in my bed. And this is exactly what
I did. Although I was much slower than  previously (due to the
absence of my friend), but these were the trail running tracks, so I
loved them. Also, at least the last one was above 5 min/km, thus
lasted more than 30 minutes and counted towards my <a href="https://www.pactapp.com/">Pact</a>.
By a coincidence, I met one of my friends in the forest during my
last 6k, so in the end, I had company.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Movies 7&amp;8/8: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part
1-146 minutes, Part 2 - 130 minutes</span></h4>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">I have to be honest, even after having a shower I was really not
in the mood of watching movies for an other 4 hours, but I couldn't
quit at that point. So I did not. I was yawning all the time, but
somehow the time went by, and I never thought I'd be so happy to see
Albus Severus Potter one day. And then, I had my well deserved sleep
:-) I don't remember much from the dreams, but one thing is clear:
just as I fall asleep, in a couple of minutes, people started waving
wands there too... 
</span><br />
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">So, my conclusions:</span></h3>
<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"></span><br />
<ul style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Yay, I did it! I would have never been able to do that
 without my friend, so I'm really thankful to Her, and I hope, that
 someday, we will do something similar together to the end. So if You
 plan to do something similar, make sure to invite some friends!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Watching so much movies is really tiring, regardless of their
 quality. In my good days I've done several 24+ hour hikings thus I
 thought that this will not be a problem. But it was, sitting and
 watching is really worse than doing some exercise.  I wouldn't say,
 that I got fed up with the movies by the end, it would be an
 exaggeration, but it is sure, I'll not watch any of them for  some
 time.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">What should be next? Learning from this experience, I plan to
 do something shorter, like a Burn trilogy. However, I also plan to
 ride my stationary bike while watching to make it a real duathlon.&nbsp;</span></li>
</span></ul>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<br />
<ul>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">And what about You, have You done anything similar before? If yes,
how was it? If not, did this post get You in the mood to do so? Which
movies will You chose? What would You do different? Let me know in
the comments, and as always, thanks for reading.

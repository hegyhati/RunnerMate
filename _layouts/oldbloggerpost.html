  This post was originally published when the blog was still hosted on Blogger. When I moved to Github Pages, I imported these without much editing, thus the layout often seems odd. You can still visit the original version <a href="{{page.originalurl}}">here</a>.
</div>

<div class="row">

<div class="col"></div>
<div class="col-xl-6">
    <div class="jumbotron">
      <h1>{{page.title}}</h1> 
      <p>{{page.date|  date_to_long_string}}</p> 
    </div>

    {{content}}
</div>
<div class="col"></div>
</div>
